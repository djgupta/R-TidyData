Converted Raw data into Tidy data using R programming Language.

Data wss extracted from raw data using list.file function. 
These data was then merged into a single dataset using rbind and cbind. 
Mean and deviation data was extracted using grep function. 
Descriptive names were given to the dataset values. 
Then tidy data was obtained uaing aggregate function.

Complete explanation on how the script works and the description of variables is included in the codebook.md.

The data represents the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
